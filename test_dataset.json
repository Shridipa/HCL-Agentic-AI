    "ground_truth": "banks and short-term deposits and investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are considered net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and are considered part of the Company\u2019s cash management system. In the standalone balance sheet, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within current liabilities. Financial assets at amortized cost A financial asset is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met: (a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows and, (b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category includes cash and bank balances, loans, unbilled receivables, trade and other receivables. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) A financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following criteria are met: (i) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and (ii) The asset\u2019s contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.",

Undistributed earnings of the subsidiaries aggregate approximately \u20b927 ,382 crores (31 March 2024, \u20b925,185 crores). The Group has the intent to reinvest the undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely in its significant overseas operations or repatriate only to the extent these can be distributed in a tax free manner. Consequently, the Company did not record a deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings except for certain subsidiaries where the undistributed earnings are estimated to be in excess of the expected reinvestment needs. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published the model rules for global minimum tax (Pillar Two model rules). Pillar Two legislation has been enacted, or substantively enacted, in certain jurisdictions where the Group operates. The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules and has evaluated the potential exposure to global minimum tax.

Company uses cost plus expected margin to determine standalone selling price. Revenue from finance leases is recognized when all risks and ownership are transferred to the customer, with no remaining obligations that affect acceptance. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of lease payments, discounted at a market interest rate. Interest from finance leases is recognized as other income on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. In instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, material or licenses, revenue is recorded on a gross basis when the Company is a principal to the transaction and net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, once control of a promised good is transferred to a customer. Revenue from certain activities in transition services in outsourcing arrangements are not capable of being distinct or represent separate performance obligation and is recognized over the period of the arrangement. Direct and incremental costs in relation to such transition activities which are expected to be recoverable under the contract are considered as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Deferred contract cost and recognized over the period of arrangement. Certain upfront non-recurring incremental contract acquisition costs and other upfront fee paid to customer are deferred and classified as Deferred contract cost and amortized to revenue, usually on a straight-line basis, over the term of the contract. An onerous contract provision is recognized when the expected unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations exceed the expected economic benefits to be received under a contract.",

    "ground_truth": "These market trends highlight the evolving role of technology as a strategic driver of business growth and innovation, prompting enterprises to partner with technology providers and invest in AI, cloud, data, legacy modernization and emerging technologies amidst their cost optimization efforts. Moreover, the industry is experiencing a paradigm shift towards non-linearity. With the focus on revenue growth becoming independent of headcount growth, intellectual properties (IPs), outcome-based models and platform-based services are becoming more prevalent. This presents service providers with a significant opportunity to capitalize on these developments by offering flexible business models and innovative solutions and leveraging advanced technologies to meet the growing demands of the market. HCLTech is leading the industry with specific programs to address these that can drive growth, enhance client experience and solidify its leadership position. Our top priority is developing full-stack AI solutions to help clients quickly go from idea to MVP (minimum viable product) to production. We are continuously enhancing our portfolio of platforms and services described earlier, including AI Force, AI Foundry, AI Labs and AI Engineering. We are prioritizing vertical digital engineering opportunities across sectors such as telecommunications, semiconductors and automotive, as these verticals are seen as key areas for growth within the ERS segment. Expanding market participation in Focus and New Frontier markets, such as Germany, France, Japan, Mexico, Brazil and others is a strategic goal. We have made impressive progress in these markets over the past few years and we plan to continue expanding our participation. The cybersecurity services industry has been experiencing significant growth, with expansion rates surpassing 20%. We intend to capitalize on this trend to further our expansion and increase our market share in the cybersecurity sector.
